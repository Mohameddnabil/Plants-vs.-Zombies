# Plants-vs.-Zombies
 <font size=18> Plants vs Zombies (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants_vs._Zombies) is a tower-defense and strategy game which involves an army of zombies trying to enter the house(lawn) and eat your brains. The only way you can stop them is by using your arsenal of plants that will zap the zombies at your command. The plants - Pea-shooters, Beetroots, Walnuts, and Sunflowers - are all set to destroy the zombies who dare to enter your backyard.
